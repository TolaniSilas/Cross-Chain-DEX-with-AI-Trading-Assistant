# Cross-Chain-DEX-with-AI-Trading-Assistant
This project is a coalescence of two groundbreaking technologies - blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) - to solve an imperative problem: **making Decentralized Finance (DeFi) accessible to everyone**, including non-technical users. With the integration of the AI Agent assistant, it turns or alters a potentially confusing Decentralized Exchange (DEX) into a guided, educational trading experience.

It is a DEX application that allows users to swap tokens across Ethereum and Polygon blockchains. This platform also features a cnversational assistant powered by AI, which makes crypto trading accessible and less intricate to noobs (newcomers) by enabling natural language commands and providing clear explanations of all operations.
